Description:
Empower Lives is a tech-driven solution aimed at addressing poverty and hunger by leveraging Google technologies. The project utilizes Flutter for the frontend, Firebase for the backend, and Google's Gemini API for intelligent content recommendations. This README provides instructions on how to run the code locally for testing and development purposes.

Instructions:

Prerequisites:

Ensure you have Flutter SDK installed on your machine. You can find installation instructions here.
Create a Firebase project and set up Firebase in your Flutter app. Follow the steps outlined here to integrate Firebase services.
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-repo-url.git
Navigate to the Project Directory:

Additional Notes:

Customize Firebase configurations in google-services.json for Android and GoogleService-Info.plist for iOS located in the android/app and ios/Runner directories respectively.
For Gemini API integration, ensure proper setup and configuration of API keys and endpoints. Refer to the Gemini API documentation for detailed instructions.
Before deploying to production, ensure all Firebase and Gemini API configurations are properly set up for security and scalability.
For any issues or questions, please refer to the project's documentation or contact the project maintainers.
